1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.

I will be using a lot of react and node to improve my javascript skills.


2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

the front-end UI is going to be my main focus. 


3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
   website, maybe mobile app at some point but for now just a website
   
4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
   to make it easier to find pricing for all sold trading cards and not just the professionally graded ones 
   
5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
trading card collectors, resellers, people trying to figure out if any of their cards are worth something.


6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
I will be using an API that will return a history of variations that were sold of the card you are searching for.


7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
maybe setup a user model/favorites model so someone can register/login, and save their favorite cards
maybe at some point allow a user to save a list of cards they have.


b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially
important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces
notoriously messy data.
returning incorrect cards that may have the same name but not be the same person, api not being updated recently,
api only saving a short time frame of information.

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
no

d. What functionality will your app include?
register,login/out, save list, search by name, return a picture

e. What will the user flow look like?
home page, welcome, click to register or click to search, input search term, see results,item(s) found or not found, click on correct card, details of pricing/card, 
favorite or not, search for new card

f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your
stretch goals?
not sure yet.
